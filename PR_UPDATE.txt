## Added "Searched Term" Filter Option

This update adds support for displaying the current search term from WordPress search queries in the taxonomy-text block and RichText inline format.

### Features

- **New Filter Source**: "Searched Term" option added to the Filter Source dropdown
- **URL Parameter Support**: Extracts search term from `?s=` URL parameter (WordPress native search)
- **URL Decoding**: Automatically decodes URL-encoded search terms (e.g., `garden+tools` → `garden tools`)
- **Prefix/Suffix Support**: Search terms support prefix and suffix text like other filter types
- **Simplified Options**: Search filter hides Value Type and Link controls since search terms don't have descriptions or archive links

### Technical Details

- Added `"search"` to `filterType` enum in `block.json`
- Updated editor components (`edit.js` and `format.js`) to handle search filter type
- Added search term extraction logic in `get_taxonomy_text_result()` function
- Search term is extracted from `$_GET['s']` or `get_query_var('s')` and URL-decoded
- Returns `null` if no search term is present (block won't render)

### Usage

When a user searches on a WordPress site (e.g., `?s=garden+tools`), the taxonomy-text block can now display the searched term dynamically. This is useful for displaying search results context like "Showing results for: garden tools" or similar messaging.
