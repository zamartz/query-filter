feat: Add "Searched Term" filter option to taxonomy-text block

Adds support for displaying the current search term from WordPress search
queries (?s= parameter) in both the standalone taxonomy-text block and the
RichText inline format.

Changes:
- Add "search" to filterType enum in block.json
- Add "Searched Term" option to Filter Source dropdown in editor
- Extract search term from $_GET['s'] or get_query_var('s')
- Decode URL-encoded search terms (e.g., "garden+tools" → "garden tools")
- Hide Value Type and Link controls for search filter (search terms only
  support prefix/suffix, no description or link options)
- Update both edit.js (standalone block) and format.js (RichText format)

The search filter will display the searched term when a WordPress search
is active, allowing dynamic display of search queries in content.
